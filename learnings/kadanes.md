**Kadane's Algorithm** is primarily used to solve the **Maximum Subarray Problem**â€”finding the contiguous subarray with the largest sum in a 1D array. While its primary application is in computational problems, it has practical real-life uses:

### **Real-Life Applications of Kadane's Algorithm**
1. **Financial Analysis**:
   - Used to find periods with maximum profit or minimum loss in stock price data.
   - Helps identify the most profitable buying and selling periods.

2. **Weather and Climate Analysis**:
   - Applied to find the longest period with the highest or lowest temperature deviations.

3. **Signal Processing**:
   - Detects maximum signal strength over time in data streams.

4. **Image Processing**:
   - Applied to identify areas with the highest intensity or patterns in images.

5. **IoT and Sensor Data**:
   - Used to analyze streams of data from sensors to detect anomalies or optimal conditions.

6. **Gaming and Pathfinding**:
   - Helps in finding optimal paths or scores in game algorithms where scores are stored in grids or arrays.

In short, Kadane's Algorithm is useful whenever you need to optimize or find maximum/minimum values in sequential or temporal data efficiently.

### Code Example

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
    int maxSum = INT_MIN; // Stores the maximum subarray sum
    int currentSum = 0;   // Tracks the current subarray sum

    for (int num : nums) {
        currentSum += num;              // Add current element to the sum
        maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum); // Update maxSum if currentSum is larger
        if (currentSum < 0)             // Reset currentSum if it becomes negative
            currentSum = 0;
    }
    return maxSum;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4};
    cout << "Maximum Subarray Sum: " << maxSubArray(nums) << endl;
    return 0;
}
