The **Dutch National Flag Algorithm** was introduced by computer scientist **Edsger W. Dijkstra** in 1976. It is named after the **Dutch national flag**, which consists of three horizontal bands of color: red, white, and blue. The algorithm was originally designed as a way to partition an array into three distinct sections, much like the flag's three colors.

### **Relation and Concept Origin**
1. **Three-Part Partitioning Problem**:
   - The algorithm solves the problem of segregating an array into three parts efficiently.
   - It was developed in the context of programming problems where multiple partitions are required, and operations must be optimized.

2. **Relation to Sorting**:
   - This concept is closely related to **partitioning algorithms**, such as the **two-way partitioning** used in the QuickSort algorithm.
   - The Dutch National Flag Algorithm extends the idea to **three-way partitioning**, which means the array is divided into three sections instead of two:
     - **Low**: Contains all elements of the first type (e.g., `0` or red).
     - **Mid**: Contains all elements of the second type (e.g., `1` or white).
     - **High**: Contains all elements of the third type (e.g., `2` or blue).

3. **Applications**:
   - It has practical use in problems involving sorting small, finite categories (e.g., `0`, `1`, `2`).
   - Modern applications include color sorting in graphics, problems in computational geometry, and even DNA sequencing where elements need partitioning into categories.

### **Relation to Flags**
The flag analogy makes the algorithm easy to understand:
- Think of each "color" as a category or type of element in the array.
- The algorithm efficiently rearranges elements such that all elements of the same type (or color) are grouped together, just like the sections in the flag.

---

### **Legacy**
- The algorithm became a foundational technique in computer science.
- It showcases Dijkstra's brilliance in designing efficient, elegant solutions for complex problems.
- The simplicity of the concept (linear time and constant space) has inspired many variations and optimizations in related areas, such as sorting and partitioning problems.

The **Dutch National Flag Algorithm** is a popular algorithm for sorting an array containing three distinct elements (e.g., 0, 1, and 2) efficiently. It is commonly used in problems like sorting colors (red, white, and blue).

### **Problem Statement**
Given an array of integers where each element is either 0, 1, or 2, sort the array in-place so that all 0s come first, followed by all 1s, and then all 2s.

---

### **Approach**
The algorithm uses three pointers:
1. **low**: Points to the position where the next `0` should go.
2. **mid**: Traverses the array.
3. **high**: Points to the position where the next `2` should go.

### **Steps**
1. Start with `low = 0`, `mid = 0`, and `high = n - 1` (last index).
2. Use a while loop (`while mid <= high`) to traverse the array:
   - **If the current element is 0**:
     - Swap it with the element at `low`.
     - Increment both `low` and `mid`.
   - **If the current element is 1**:
     - Move `mid` to the next position (no action needed for 1s).
   - **If the current element is 2**:
     - Swap it with the element at `high`.
     - Decrement `high`.
     - Do not increment `mid` because the swapped element at `mid` may still need processing.
3. Continue until `mid` crosses `high`.

### **Code Implementation**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void dutchNationalFlag(vector<int>& nums) {
    int low = 0, mid = 0, high = nums.size() - 1;

    while (mid <= high) {
        if (nums[mid] == 0) {
            swap(nums[low], nums[mid]); // Place 0 at the correct position
            low++;
            mid++;
        } else if (nums[mid] == 1) {
            mid++; // Leave 1 in place
        } else { // nums[mid] == 2
            swap(nums[mid], nums[high]); // Place 2 at the correct position
            high--;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0};
    dutchNationalFlag(nums);

    // Print the sorted array
    for (int num : nums) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### **How It Works**
- **Initial State**:
  - `low = 0, mid = 0, high = n - 1`.
  - Array: [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0].

- **First Iteration** (`mid = 0`):
  - `nums[mid] = 2`. Swap `nums[mid]` and `nums[high]`, decrement `high`.
  - Array: [0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2].

- **Second Iteration** (`mid = 0`):
  - `nums[mid] = 0`. Swap `nums[mid]` and `nums[low]`, increment `low` and `mid`.
  - Array: [0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2].

- **Third Iteration** (`mid = 1`):
  - `nums[mid] = 0`. Swap `nums[mid]` and `nums[low]`, increment `low` and `mid`.
  - Array: [0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2].

- Continue processing until `mid > high`.

### **Time Complexity**
- **O(n)**: Each element is processed at most once.

### **Space Complexity**
- **O(1)**: Sorting is done in-place without extra space.

### **Key Points**
1. The algorithm is very efficient for arrays with three distinct values.
2. It avoids unnecessary iterations and keeps the operation in linear time.
3. Commonly used in problems like sorting colors or partitioning arrays.
